# Known limitations

Gaps and platform restrictions in the current release. Feature status: [AI_ASSISTANT_ARCHITECTURE.md](AI_ASSISTANT_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Reminders

- **Google Play and exact alarms.** `app.json` requests `USE_EXACT_ALARM` and `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` so reminders
  fire on time on Android 14+. That's fine for the demo APK, but Google Play only allows `USE_EXACT_ALARM` for
  apps whose core function is an alarm clock or calendar. A Play Store release must drop `USE_EXACT_ALARM`
  and either request `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` at runtime (the user grants it in system settings) or fall back to
  inexact alarms (Android may then delay a reminder by up to about an hour; expo-notifications already falls back
  automatically when exact alarms aren't allowed).
- **Local notification cap.** iOS keeps at most 64 pending local notifications. The app schedules the soonest 60
  and logs how many later ones it skipped; they're scheduled on a later re-sync (app open, any task/routine/
  settings change). If the app isn't opened for days, later reminders may be missing until it is.
- Reminders are planned 7 days ahead; the WhatsApp reminder job only runs when Twilio is configured.

## Safety

- Crisis detection is a deterministic phrase list (English, Roman Urdu, Urdu script) in
  `backend/src/modules/mood/crisis.ts`. It must be reviewed by a native Urdu speaker before release, and the
  helpline numbers in `CRISIS_RESOURCES` must be verified (`// VERIFY BEFORE RELEASE`). A mental-health helpline
  is intentionally left as a placeholder (not shown) until someone verifies one.
